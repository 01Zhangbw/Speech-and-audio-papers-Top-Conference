### Summary

The accepted(or not) status depends on rate mainly. The rate of speech/audio track is not high, which is much less than the tracks like CV, NLP, etc. **The rebuttals are very important!!!**

## ICLR'24

### Speech

It includes the papers on speech (rate is good or middle, often more than 5), not limited to accepted or not.

Total speech papers@ICLR24 number is **50+**; We select  **20+** papers.
